Flutter is a popular open-source mobile application development framework enabling developers to build beautiful, high-performance, natively compiled mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms using a single codebase. In this blog, we will guide you through the process of learning Flutter development from scratch.

### Prerequisites:

1. Before you can start building Flutter apps, you must set up your development environment. This includes installing the **Flutter SDK, Android Studio, and VS Code, XCode, and Cocoapods** you might need. If you haven't already installed Flutter, follow the instructions on the official Flutter website to download and install it on your computer.
    
2. Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language with a syntax that is easy to learn and understand. You should spend some time learning Dart programming, including its **syntax**, **data types**, **variables**, **functions**, and **control structures**.
    

Here's a quick reference of important things to keep in mind when using Dart for Flutter:

**Data Structures and Variables:**

```dart
// Importing core libraries
import 'dart:math';
// Importing libraries from external packages
import 'package:test/test.dart';
// Importing files
import 'path/to/my_other_file.dart';

void main(){
    // This is a normal, one-line comment.
    
    /// This is a documentation comment, used to document libraries,
    /// classes, and their members. Tools like IDEs and dartdoc treat
    /// doc comments specially.

    int x = 2;
    var p = 5;
    dynamic z = 8;
    z = "cool";
    final email = "temid@gmail.com"; 
    const qty = 5;

    var multilist = [];
    multilist.add([1,2]);
    multilist.add([3,6,1,4,6,9]);
    for (List<int> i in multilist) {
        print ("list: $i");
        i.sort((x,y) {
            return x>y ? x : y;
        });
        print("sorted list: ${i.toString()}");
    }


   var person = {};
   person["name"] = "Khandoker Kafi Anan";
   person["age"] = 22;
   person["socials"] = {
     "facebook": "https://facebook.com/khandoker.anan",
     "website" : "https://khandokeranan.com",
     "linkedin": "httpsL//linkedin.com/in/khandokeranan"
   };
   person["favorite_numbers"] = [6,5,11,28,101,7,3];
  
   person.forEach( (key,val) {
     print ("$key : $val");
   });

}
```

**Class, Inheritance, mixin, and Polymorphism:**

```dart
class Analytics {
    int totalViewsCount = 0;
    int blogId = 0;
    Analytics (int blogId, int totalViewsCount) {
      this.blogId = blogId;
      this.totalViewsCount = totalViewsCount;
    }
    void increaseView () {
      totalViewsCount++;
    }
}

class Audio {
    void playSound (String filename) {
        print ("Playing $filename");
    }
}

class BlogWriter extends Analytics with Audio{
    String? title, description, author;
    BlogWriter( super.blogId, super.totalViewsCount, { required this.title, this.description, required this.author});
  
    void showDetails () {
        description ??= "No description found";
        print ("Title: $title\nDescription: $description\nAuthor: $author\nBlog ID: $blogId\nTotal Views: $totalViewsCount");
    }
    
    @override 
    void increaseView () {
      totalViewsCount+=2;
    }
}

void main () {
    
    BlogWriter bw = BlogWriter(11, 2011, title: "Anan's Sight", description: "This is a blog", author: "Khandoker Anan");
    bw.increaseView ();
    bw.showDetails();
    bw.playSound("C:/app/anan.mp3");

}
```

**Optional Function Passing in a Function:**

```dart
int maxVal (List<int> v) {
    int maxv = -999999999999;
    for (int i=0; i<v.length; i++) {
        maxv = (maxv < v[i]) ? v[i] : maxv;
    }
    return maxv;
}
void deleteMaxVal(var v, {Function max = maxVal}) {
  var maxValue = max(v);
  bool check = v is List && v.isNotEmpty && maxValue.runtimeType.toString() == v[0].runtimeType.toString();
  if (check) {
    v.remove(maxValue); 
    print (v);
  }
  
}
void main () {
  var v = [4,3,6,1,3,11,33,55,1,21];
  print (maxVal (v));
  deleteMaxVal(v, max: maxVal);
}
```
